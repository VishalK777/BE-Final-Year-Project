<h3>
    Step-by-step setup installation guide Project. This assumes you have Python and Django already installed on your system. If not, make sure to install Python and set up a virtual environment first.
</h3>


### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd <project location on disk>
   

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended to isolate project dependencies):
   
   python -m venv venv
   

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     
     venv\Scripts\activate
    
   - On macOS and Linux:
    
     source venv/bin/activate
     

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Ensure you're in the project directory with the virtual environment activated.

2. Install the project dependencies using pip:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

1. Create the database tables and apply migrations:
   
   python manage.py migrate
   

2. Create a superuser account (an admin account) by following the prompts:
   
   python manage.py createsuperuser


### Step 4: Run the Development Server

1. Start the Django development server:
   
   python manage.py runserver
   

2. Open your web browser and access the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You should see your Django project's homepage.

### Step 5: Access the Admin Panel

1. To access the admin panel, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log in using the superuser account credentials you created earlier.

### Step 6: Start Developing

You're now set up to start developing your Django project. You can build and customize your application by adding models, views, templates, and other components as needed.

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working on your project:

deactivate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/deactivate  # On macOS and Linux


That's it! You've successfully set up and installed your Django project.
